## Presentation

This is an experimental project to play with Strapi / NodeJs and Svelte. The goal is to develop a front-end integrated PageBuilder, with SSR, optimized performance and client-side SPA mode.

The goal is mainly to explore the possibilities offered by these tools.

No functional goal: the project will take over classical contents and hierarchies that can be found on many sites.
